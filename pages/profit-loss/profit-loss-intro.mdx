# Introduction to Profit & Loss


Profit and Loss, often referred to as P&L or PnL, is a term used to describe the current state of a user's active positions while trading. By observing P&L users will be able to determine whether their positions are either in profit or loss.

A user's current position on Drift is the cumulative sum of all their filled orders (increasing, reducing, or closing) over time. All trading lots, per market and per subaccount, are combined into a single position to determine P&L.  

The position table below shows the **P&L** for the current position. Users can toggle `$` or `%` to change whether they would like to see **P&L** in dollar terms ($) or in percentage terms (%).

In the above image, the P&L refers to the **unrealised P&L** or **uPNL** of the open positions (SOL-PERP and ETH-PERP shorts). To realise this P&L, users will have to close their positions.  

The PnL in the table above is calculated as the difference between the position's `Entry Price` with the current oracle price multiplied by the `Size`.

## Withdrawing Realised P&L

A user's realised P&L can only be withdrawn once it has been settled/claimed on-chain.  

**Note:** Realising P&L by closing the position is **_not_** the same as settling/claiming P&L. To withdraw a positive P&L, it must be settled/claimed first. 

### Settling and Claiming your P&L

To update the USDC balances available for withdrawal, your P&L must first be settled and claimed.

To do so, navigate to the `Unrealised PnL` tab and select `Claim`

Users can claim positive P&L when:

1.  the open position has been closed or reduced (i.e. your uP&L has been partially or wholly realised); _note: this step is only necessary when the pnl pool balance is limited_

2.  the market's P&L Pool has available balances to claim; and  

3.  their Cost Basis is below the Entry Price for longs or above the Entry Price for shorts.

## What is the difference between Settling P&L and Realising P&L?

The main difference between settling P&L and realising P&L is that realised P&L is available to be withdrawn and used elsewhere whereas settled P&L is not.  

Once realised, your P&L must also be settled and claimed before it can be withdrawn.

### Realised P&L

Realised P&L refers to the profit and loss that is realised by the user when they close their position.  

**For example:**

If you entered a long position on SOL at \$30 and SOL is now \$60; you would be in profit with an unrealised P&L of \$30.  

Similarly, if you entered a short position on SOL at \$30 and SOL is now \$15; you would be in profit with an unrealised P&L of \$15.  

The profit and loss in both those examples are known as **unrealised P&L** (uP&L) as that position is still open. The uP&L of the position will continuously change as the price of the asset changes.  

Your P&L will not be **realised** until you close your position. Once you close your position, your uP&L will become **realised P&L** and you will be out of that perpetual futures position (i.e. you will no longer have exposure to the price movement of that underlying asset).
