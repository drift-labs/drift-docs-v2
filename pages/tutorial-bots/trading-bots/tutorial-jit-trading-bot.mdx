# JIT Maker Bot

This tutorial shows how to run a JIT Maker bot in Typescript from the [keeper-bots-v2 repo](https://github.com/drift-labs/keeper-bots-v2). A similar example written in Python is available in [keepyrs](https://github.com/drift-labs/keepyrs).

Market orders go through the [Just-In-Time (JIT) Auctions](/about-v2/jit-auctions) where Makers fight to fill orders before the order is allowed to fill against the [Drift AMM](/about-v2/drift-amm).


## Running the bot

**☠️ This bot requires collateral to run. This tutorial is a developer's guide and holds no responsibility over bot outcomes.**

### 1. Clone the repository

The JIT Maker example lives in the keeper-bots-v2 repo, clone it to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/drift-labs/keeper-bots-v2.git
```


### 2. Prepare a keypair and drift account.

Refer to the [bot wallet setup](/getting-started/wallet-setup/bot-wallet-setup) tutorial for how to set up a bot wallet.


### 3. Prepare the config file.

The [`jit-maker-config.yaml`](https://github.com/drift-labs/keeper-bots-v2/blob/master/jit-maker-config.yaml) file is good starting point. You will need to fill in the following values:

* `global.endpoint`: set this to your RPC endpoint (see [RPC Providers](/tutorial-bots/rpc-providers))
* `global.keeperPrivateKey`: set this to your bot private key (alternatively you can leave it blank and set the `KEEPER_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable)
* `botConfigs.jitMaker.aggressivenessBps`: this is how aggressive you want your jit maker to be. If set to 30, the bot will attempt to buy 30 bps above the best bid, and sell 30 bps below the best ask.
* `botConfigs.jitMaker.marketType` (`perp` or `spot`): this is the type of market we want to jit make
* `botConfigs.jitMaker.marketIndexes`: this is the list of markets that we want to jit make, it
* `botConfigs.jitMaker.subaccounts`: this is the subaccount to use for each marketIndex provided


Note: `subaccounts` and `marketIndexes` are a direct mapping, so the below config will use subaccount 0 for marketIndex 0, and subaccount 1 for marketIndex 1:

```yaml
botConfigs:
  jitMaker:
    marketType: perp
    marketIndexes:
      - 0
      - 1
    subaccounts:
      - 0
      - 1
```

### 4. Run the bot

Now you are ready to run the bot, start it with:

```
yarn run dev --config-file=jit-maker-config.yaml
```


## Technical Explanation

### Strategy overview

This bot uses the [`JitterShotgun`](https://github.com/drift-labs/jit-proxy/blob/master/ts/sdk/src/jitter/jitterShotgun.ts#L13) strategy and the [`jit-proxy`](https://github.com/drift-labs/jit-proxy) program to try to fill jit maker fills.

The JitterShotgun strategy continuously sends transactions in an attempt to fill orders as soon as it sees one that crosses. The `jit-proxy` program is a permissionless and stateless program that does the last-mile checks on-chain to ensure the fill is within our desired bid/ask price and does not exeeed min/max positions.


### JIT-able orders

Orders with `auctionDuration > 0` may be filled by jit makers at any time. This bot finds these orders by using the `programSubscribe` RPC method, and filtering for users with new orders that meet this criteria.


### Final notes and future optimizations

This is a very simple and naiive strategy, some oppotunities for improvements:
* allow multiple markets and spot + perp at the same time
* asymetric bid/ask offsets, allow the different `aggressivenessBps` for bid/ask depending on how you want to skew your quotes
* an improved `JitterShotgun` strategy that is more cognizant of time and transactions sent


## Troubleshooting

### Resubscribing log messages

```
No ws data from user in 30000ms, resubscribing
No ws data from userStats in 30000ms, resubscribing
No ws data from perpMarket in 30000ms, resubscribing
No ws data from perpMarket in 30000ms, resubscribing
No ws data from perpMarket in 30000ms, resubscribing
No ws data from spotMarket in 30000ms, resubscribing
```

This is a notification from the Drift SDK that it is restarting its websocket connection with the RPC due to no messages being received within the set time. This is generatlly not an error and pretty common for less active markets that don't have much activity.

### Running JIT periodic tasks...

```
[2024-02-27T00:04:31.387Z] Running JIT periodic tasks...
[2024-02-27T00:04:31.389Z] info: (mkt index: JTO-PERP) base to market make (targetLvg=0.95): 1481.8891930588115 = 3476.551044 / 2.228725 * 0.95
```

This is a normal status message that the bot is running its periodic tasks. If you see this message, it means the bot is running as expected.


###  Order does not cross params yet, retrying

Failed to fill 24yfkkuFv849BpCBBo49tV6i6ycfc3aEUY6wWKFsN4SS-177961
Order does not cross params yet, retrying
```

This is a failed tx message from the RPC provider when a transaction is sent. It is common for the shotgun strategy to get this message as it sends many transactions at once.

Decoding it further:
* It is a jit fill attempt on taker `24yfkkuFv849BpCBBo49tV6i6ycfc3aEUY6wWKFsN4SS`'s orderId:`177961`
* the current slot (that the RPC is simulating the transaction in) is 250667476, the auction lasts for 32 slots, and there are 15 slots left
* the taker's order is an Oracle order, with an offset of -12100 (-\$0.0121) to -200 (-\$0.0020)
* the taker's order is a `buy` (since it is comparing with our `ask` price)
* the taker's price at that slot is 2220700 (\$2.2207), which is below our worst ask 2234257 (\$2.2343), so the jit-proxy program threw and error to prevent us from sending a failing transaction on chain
